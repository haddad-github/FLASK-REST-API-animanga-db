# REST API for Anime and Manga

### This repository contains all the files that were used to create the API; a private repository is used as the host for Heroku

#### Accessing the entire database:
https://animanga-db.herokuapp.com/anime/
https://animanga-db.herokuapp.com/manga/

#### Currently takes int ID's, such as:
https://animanga-db.herokuapp.com/anime/852
https://animanga-db.herokuapp.com/manga/57382

Upcoming feature:
1) Main page with basic documentation
2) Accessing animes by title, with an algorithm that'll choose the closest match if the requested title can't be found (spelling errors, etc.)
